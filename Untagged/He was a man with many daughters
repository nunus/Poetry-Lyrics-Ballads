He was a man with 
many daughters, no sons.

In a civil warm my husband's great grandfather
was informed his entire family
(each precious young girl, his wife)
had been slaughtered.

He collapsed they say.
To care for him 
They dipped him repeatedly in freezing ice water until his racing heart
(his love filled heart)
went still.

Imagine those hands on him.
The barrel of ice.  This gentle man.
Hands holding him down to cure him,
Free him.  (How certain, how well intended, how evil) 

The news had been cruel trick.
His family lived,
lost everything.
