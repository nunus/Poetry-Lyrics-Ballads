A head long rush
a star a dream
a stumble a tunnel
open maw of earth
a glowing jewel.

A girl in a well
an innocent demon
in alice's pinafore
Men
who photograph children
in hell

A forest of rotting trees
as the crow flies
crow's lines
in eyes lucky to have survived

looking
down the dark shaft
reaching a hand down
along the old stones
into a well of vengence
