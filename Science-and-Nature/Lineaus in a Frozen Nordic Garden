Lineaus in a frozen Nordic Garden
naming things
Linneaus
could not have foreseen this

Our bodies as a teeming universe
of which humanity
by cellular quantity
is minority

This is us:
our genes entwined with virus
our bodies a ship
an amalgam
of a billion little lives

A ferment

Being human doesn't mean
what it used to anymore

And yet
Whatever I am has loved
the evolving swarming mass of you
I know it
whatever love is
whatever being means



Here was the original:

Biology once dismissed as plebian
Lineaus in a fozen nordic garden
naming things
Now turns a minute gaze
to the teeming universe
That is the ody
more cells of microorganisms
than human
our very DNA entwined with virus
alive and changing crudly
turning on and off
much stranger than we 
Could have imagined
we do not like to see
ourselves thus,
A walking fermentation
just as we resist to see the primate
starting boldly back in mirrors.

An amalgam
the microscope reveals
not individual but a synthesis,
a stew.
