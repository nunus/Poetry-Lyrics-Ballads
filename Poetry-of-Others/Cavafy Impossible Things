Impossible things
-Cavafy

There is one joy alone
but one that's blessed
one consolation only in this pain

How many tawdry days 
were missed because of this
ending
how much ennui

A poet has said: " The loveliest
music is the one that cannot 
be played." And I, I daresay
that by far the best life
is the one that cannot
be lived.
