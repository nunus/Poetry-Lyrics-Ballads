Twilight: After Haying
Jane Kenyon

Yes, long shadows go out
from the bales; and yes, the soul
must part from the body:
what else could it do?

The men sprawl near the baler,
too tired to leave the field.
They talk and smoke,
and the tips of their cigarettes
blaze like small roses
in the night air. (It arrived
and settled among them
before they were aware.)

The moon comes
to count the bales,
and the dispossessed-
Whip-poor-will, Whip-poor-will
-sings from the dusty stubble.

These things happen... the soul's bliss
and suffering are bound together
like the grasses...

The last, sweet exhalations
of timothy and vetch
go out with the song of the bird,
the ravaged field
grows wet with dew.
