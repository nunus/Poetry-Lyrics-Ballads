This cold morning
aching from a fall on the ice
I feel as if someone
could cut me open
and read on my exhausted struggling
tissues your name written
into the sinews
that hold together my soul.

This is a feeling and 
this is a poem.  A poem
I should crumple 
up and toss away
promising instead to love you
Daily to love you
to think of your best interest
your comfort, your daily bread.
