It's my nature to fly away
I take peace with me
trailing torn bits of promises
unlasted straps, broken twigs, stolen threads
of plans woven previously
together

the velocity of lifting away
shakes and breaks apart
the brittle balance of daily life
the detant of daily of life
home is a collection of circumstance
the magpie joy
over bits of sparkling glass
easily lost

But I do return and remake
plucking from my own flesh
a down to keep the cold at bay
a thin barrier in which to rest and dream
of never leaving again.
