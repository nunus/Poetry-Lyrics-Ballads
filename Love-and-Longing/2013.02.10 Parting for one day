After so much absence
this weakness:
I with broken heart
at parting for one day.

The urgency is back with me
devouring feeling.

You, whomever you are becoming,
unrolling into,
I want to bow before you
lay my forehead to the earth 
to learn to honour you
as I learn to forgive you
to beg forgiveness.
