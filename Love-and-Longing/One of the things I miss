One of the things I miss
Most is being able 
to tell youa million
inconsequentional things.

(Maybe that is why you are getting so much work done?)

Kalle, I want to describe
how strange it is to see
sheets of snow and ice 
falling off the roof
of the old building across
from my beautiful office.

Kalle, I miss being able to share
all the meaningless things that happen
and makde up my days.
What a luxury it is to have
someone like you to tell things to.

Kalle, I want to let you know
How I saved the images you created
Out of binary strings and came upon them
suddenly by accident and
was amazed all over again by you.

Kalle, I wat to tell you that
I am the sort of person that sometimes feels
overwhelmed by love
but love for you is the only thing that does this to me.
That I am afraide my daily attempts are not good enough
That wild emotions and intentions will leave undone
the daily work and acts of love.
