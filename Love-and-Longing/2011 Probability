Each day
we open the box
Our passage through time
seems involuntary.

The probability of
ending up here is 
so low but

We change reality with observation
I noticed you
You had a white shirt which read
WORDS

In ninty-nine out of a hundred
universes
I clung to my native land
my hands settled in the dust
of the volcanic west.

Better we look inside
we are both dead
and alive
Both completely ordinary
and miraculous. 
Each day a container
unfolding: A gift
the appex of which is the 
opening.
