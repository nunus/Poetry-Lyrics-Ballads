You are Spring
A lion sun after winter
A guide in the heavens
You heat the barren earth
You do not forget me.

In winter I spin away
but you keep me.
You are everything
Without you
only ice and iron.

You burn me
Make my skin crawl [with life]
You move
I follow.

You do not forget me.  
Without you
only ice and iron.
