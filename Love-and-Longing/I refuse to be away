Kalle
I refuse to be away from you
for one more day.

When I love you
when my heart is aching like it is tonight
I want to be there to hold you so you can feel
that this is yours
as it is yours right now.

You are just a man
I know it.
Sometimes I have longed to lift
this love from my heart and throw it down.

There are a million ways to do that.
But I refuse to be away from you
for one more day.
What if that day was the day when I was most beautiful?
But more, it is one more
unrecoupable day where I cannot lay my head on your shoulder,
hold your head in my hands,
fall asleep with you.

This is a life unfolding
a leaf unfurling towards the sun
And it is so short.
I want you to see me if there is anything to see.
And when I am buring like I am tonight
I want to hold you so you can feel
that this heart is yours.
