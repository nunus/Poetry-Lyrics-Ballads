If I were a blacksmith
then with glowing iron
I would forge myself a dagger
I would escape from this dungeon

If I were a singer
then I would find a chorus
to lift all my sorrow
as the song would rise above us

If I were an artist
I would paint this life in color
burn awa my darkness
in one piece and then another

If I were a soldier
I would run towards fire
I would leave my heart fully open
So it would bleed out this desire

But I'm not a blacksmith
nor able to carry a tune
From this longing there's no escape
as from the sun, for distant moon.
