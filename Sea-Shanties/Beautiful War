The truth is a mountain
whose guts are liquid
The mud is a mouth that
swallows men

The mud in my boots
The ice in my eye 
My fingers were bleeding
My head was on fire

There is a story
I cannot tell you
The truth is a child
She is sleeping
don't wake her

What are we but
migratory birds
struggle from the water
to come back again
Shoot us don't matter
magnetic north 
is deep in our veins

The horror
and desire
The thiness of skin
You want to survive
to come back again

a veil on widow
forget her
she wants that
you let her go

don't wake her
don't tell her
it is what it is
The beauty the terror
the game that is
