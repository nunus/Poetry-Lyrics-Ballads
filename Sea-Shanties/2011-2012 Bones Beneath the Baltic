The bones beneath the baltic say
That all their silver has washed away
The iron, though, has rusted stayed
Far down beneath the icy waves

The bones beneath the baltic say
that schools of herrings now do play
where tongues once whispered words of love
to maids in cities far away

The bones beneath the baltic say
That all their silver has washed away
The iron, though, has rusted stayed
Down beneath the waves

The bones beneath the baltic say
they cannot see the sky above
nor feel the warmth of day
And the girls did not wait long for love
And when the iron rusts it rusts like blood
Down beneath the waves

The bones beneath the baltic say
That all their silver has washed away
The iron, though, has rusted stayed
Far down beneath the icy waves

The bones beneath the baltic say
As boys the sea was just a game

(and from the sea our bounty came
water seemed made for battle and trade
but swallowed our treasure all the same
and we swallowed the water
beneath the waves)

From battle and trade our bounty came
Water swallowed our treasure all the same
we swallowed the water that erased our names
Down beneath the waves


their treasure and names lost all the same 

And the girls did not wait long for love
And when the iron rusts it rusts like blood
And all their silver has washed away
The iron, though, has rusted stayed
